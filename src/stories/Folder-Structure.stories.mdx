### Folder Structure

- `index.tsx`
- `<ComponentName>.styles.ts`
- `<ComponentName>.types.ts`
- `<ComponentName>.tsx`
- `<ComponentName>.spec.tsx**`
- `<ComponentName>.stories.tsx**`
- `any subcomponent directories`

***only if the stories or tests pertain specifically to the component in this directory; meaning it may not be necessary for many internal subcomponents*

The folder structure should be identical for all components. In other words, **all subcomponents are simply components**, and they should be structured identically to reflect that.
